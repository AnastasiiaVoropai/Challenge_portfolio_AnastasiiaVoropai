# Task 1: software configuration
## Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?
Hi! My name is Anastasiia. I decided to participate in the project because it's a great chance to improve my testing skills and get new ones.
I want to learn how to write good automation tests, as it's interesting for me to find errors and bugs in different applications.
My goal is to explore new technologies, meet wonderful people and as a result of all get a job of an Automated Tester.
